\begin{assumption}
\label{assm:1}
We assume that there exists $d$-column base factors, denoted by $V(J^*,:)$, such that all row of $V$ can be written as a convex combination of $V(J^*,:)$ and the zero vector and $J^* = [d]$. We denote the column factors by $V^* = V(J*,:)$. Therefore, for any $i\in [L]$, it can be represented by
\begin{align*}
V(i,:) = a_i V(J^*,:) , 
\end{align*}
where $\exists a_i\in [0,1]^{d}$ and $ ||a_i||_1 \leq 1$.
