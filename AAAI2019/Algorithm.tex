We propose the algorithm Latent Ranked Bandit, abbreviated as LRB (see Algorithm \ref{alg:latent-rank}) for solving the personalized ranking problem. This algorithm is motivated by the Ranked Bandit Algorithm (RBA) from \citet{radlinski2008learning} which is suited for finding a global ranking amongst all the users in the cascade based model. LRB is divided into two main components, the $d$ column MABs denoted by MAB$_1(n)$, MAB$_2(n), \dots,$ MAB$_d(n)$ and the $K$ row Weighted Majority Algorithms (WMA) for each user $[K]$. The WMA is motivated from \citet{littlestone1994weighted} which is suited for the total information setting. Note, that in our DCM setting all the clicks by the user is seen by the system and so it is a variation of total information setting. Each WMA consist of $d!$ arms for each of the permutations of rank $d$. Its main goal is to suggest a permutation $\Pi_{i_t}(S_t), \exists S_t \subseteq [L]$ such that the best item for the user $i_t$ is in rank $1$ of the permutation $\Pi_{i_t}(S_t)$.  LRB proceeds as follows, at every timestep $t\in[n]$ a user $i_t$ is revealed by nature, then the $d$ column MABs suggests columns ${\ell}_{1}, {\ell}_{2},\dots, {\ell}_{d}$ which it deems to be the $d$ best columns and by virtue of our setting, the $d$ hott-topics. If, there is any overlap in the suggestion, an arbitrary column is suggested which has not been selected before. Then, the row WMA for the $i_t$-th user selects a permutation $\Pi_{i_t}({\ell}_{1}, {\ell}_{2},\dots, {\ell}_{d})$ by sampling through its distribution over the $d$-ranks and suggests $\tilde{\ell}_{1}, \tilde{\ell}_{2},\dots, \tilde{\ell}_{d}$ such that the item in rank $1$ is the best item for the $i_t$-th user. 

Finally, after all the user clicks are recorded by the system both the column MABs and row WMA (for the $i_t$-th user only) is updated. The column bandits are updated with feedback $f_{k,t} = \max_{j\in [k]} r_t(i_t, \ell_{j,t}) - \max_{j\in [k-1]} r_t(i_t,\ell_{j,t})$ such the monotonicity and submodularity properties discussed in section \ref{related} are maintained. Note that RBA is also a special case of submodular bandits such that $f_{k,t}\in\lbrace 0, 1\rbrace$ \citep{streeter2009online}. The row WMA update for the $i_t$-th user is quite straightforward as all the rewards for the $d$ clicks are observed. An illustrative diagram of the entire process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rankedbandit}.
