In this paper, we study the problem of recommending the best items to users who are coming sequentially. The learner has access to very less prior information about the users (cold start) and it has to adapt quickly to the user preferences and suggest the best item to each user. Furthermore, we consider a latent variable model such that the user-item preferences are generated as a mixture of user features and item features. Note, that only noisy observations from the user-item preference matrix is only visible to the learner and not the latent user or item features. The user-item preference matrix is low-rank in nature which is very common in recommender systems \citep{koren2009matrix}, \citep{ricci2011liorrokach}. Also, we assume that each user has a single best item preference.

	This complex problem can be conceptualized as a low rank online learning  problem where there are $K$ users and $L$ items. The reward matrix, denoted by $M\in [0,1]^{K\times L}$,  generating the rewards for user, item pair has a low rank structure. The online learning game proceeds as follows, at every timestep $t$,  nature reveals one user (or row) from $M$ where user is denoted by $i_t$. The learner selects $d$ items (or columns) from $[L]$, where an item is denoted by $j_t\in [L]$. Then the learner receives feedback $r_{t}(i_t,j_t)$ for all the $d$ items suggested from one noisy realization of $M(i_t,j_t)$ such that $\E[r_{t}(i_t,j_t)] = M(i_t,j_t)$. Then the goal of the learner is to minimize the cumulative regret , that is to minimize the total number of wrong items displayed over time to the user. Hence, the learner needs to quickly identify the best item $j^*$ for each $i\in [K]$ where $M(i,j^*) = \argmax _{j\in[L]} M(i,j)$. 
	
	This learning model can be conceptualized in the real-world scenario where the learner has  to suggest movies to users and each movie belongs to a different genre (say thriller, romance, comedy, etc). So, the learner can suggest $d$ movies belonging to different genres to each incoming user in a webpage, and the user can click one, or all, or none of the recommended movies (query abandonement).
