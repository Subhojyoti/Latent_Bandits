In this paper, we studied the problem of suggesting a diverse list of items to users, with the best item of individual users at rank position $1$. We formulated the above problem as a personalized ranking problem and proposed the Latent Ranked Bandit algorithm for this setting. We proved that an instance of algorithm has  a regret bound that scales as $O\left( \right)$ and has the correct order with respect to user, items and rank of the user-item preference matrix $M$. We also evaluated our proposed algorithm on several simulated and real-life datasets and show that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

There are several future directions where this work can be extended. \todosb{suggest some future directions}
