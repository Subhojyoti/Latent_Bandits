In this paper, we studied the problem of suggesting a diverse list of items to users, with the best permutation of those items for individual users. The best permutation of items for an user contains its preference for the items in descending order with the best item at rank position $1$. We formulated the above problem as a personalized ranking problem and proposed the latent ranker algorithm for this setting. We proved that an instance of algorithm has  a regret bound that scales as $O\left(\frac{d \sqrt{L n}}{\Delta} + K \log n + K d \log d\right)$ and has the correct order with respect to users, items and rank of the user-item preference matrix $M$. We also evaluated our proposed algorithm on several simulated and real-life datasets and show that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

There are several directions where this work can be extended. Note, that observing $d$ items at every timestep is helping LRA to learn more efficiently. Hence,  while keeping the hott-topics assumption it is worthwhile to study the personalized ranking setting when only $1$ item is allowed to be suggested at every timestep $t$. Another interesting direction is to look at structures where there are hott-topics assumption on user matrix as well as item matrix or maybe even at structures beyond hott-topics.
