% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)

% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\begin{abstract}
We study the problem of learning personalized ranked lists of diverse items for multiple users, from sequential observations of user preferences. The user-item preference matrix is non-negative and low-rank. Existing methods for solving similar problems are based on reconstructing the preference matrix from its noisy observations using matrix factorization techniques, and typically require strong assumptions on the reconstructed matrix. We depart from this standard approach and consider a family of low-rank matrices, where the set of most preferred items of all users is small and can be learned efficiently. Then we learn to present this set to each user in a personalized manner, in the order of the descending preferences of the user. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that implements this procedure, which we call latent ranker (LRA). We evaluate the algorithm empirically on several synthetic and real-world datasets. In all experiments, we outperform existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019. Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
